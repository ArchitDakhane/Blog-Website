    <section class="post-content">
        <p>Lucknow University will offer an online Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and a Master of Arts (MA) in Sanskrit,
        Political Science, Economics, and English. The University Grants Commission (UGC) recently granted permission for LU to
        offer five additional courses online.</p>
        <img src="./Images/educpost1.1.jpeg" alt="University" class="post-image">
        <p>The University started offering BCom, MCom, and MBA degrees online from the academic session 2024-25. The degrees earned through these online courses will be equivalent to their respective regular degrees.</p>
        <p>The varsity spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, ‚ÄúWe will shortly open the admission window for the new online courses.
        The admission process for these courses must be completed by Nov 15. All relevant information will be made available on
        the website‚Äù. He added, ‚ÄúThe BBA course consists of six semesters (three years), while MA courses comprise four
        semesters (two years). All study materials will be accessible to students online, and mentors will address their
        queries. Students must visit the campus only once for the semester examination.</p>
        <p>He further stated that the advantage of introducing full-time courses in the online mode is that students can pursue them from any part of the country. Furthermore, this benefits several working professionals, students from humble backgrounds, and those who cannot leave their villages and districts to attend regular classes.</p>
        <p>Lucknow University has initiated the online teaching process through the Luchknow University Center for Online and Distance Education (LUCODE) from the 2023-24 session. BCom and MCom courses have been conducted online since February 2024. The examinations for this session‚Äôs first semester were completed offline last month.</p>
        <p>Lucknow University aims to contribute to transforming society for a better future. It stands for academic excellence and
        integrity. It is expected to maintain the highest ethical standards, be socially responsible, and be accountable to the
        University of Lucknow‚Äôs vision and mission. The University‚Äôs vision is to develop human resources for the furtherance of
        knowledge through teaching, research, and innovation and to rank amongst the world‚Äôs top educational institutions for
        better service to humanity in general and our nation in particular.</p>
