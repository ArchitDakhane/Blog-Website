        best ghats in India. I love the vibrancy and character of the Assi Ghat area the most. A mix of western and eastern
        sensibilities, Assi Ghat is one of the most unusual places to visit in Varanasi.</p>
        <p>Every time I am in Varanasi, I have always stayed in and around Assi Ghat because of various reasons. I love Assi Ghat‚Äôs
        laidback pace of life, especially on a balmy winter afternoon. The low-cost of rooms around Assi Ghat, even in the peak
        season also make it one of my favorite places to stay. Thanks to a large number of western tourists who live in Assi

        <p><b>Nomenclature/Etymology of Assi Ghat</b></p>
        <p>Why is Assi Ghat called so? Here is a detailed information on why and how did Assi Ghat get its name? There are various
        interesting stories on why Assi Ghat is named so! It is an interesting name and is unlike the name of any other ghat of
        Varanasi. Here is the interesting Assi Ghat story.</p>
        <p><b>How did Assi Ghat and Kashi become holy?</b></p>
        <p>Here is story version 1. Why is it called Assi Ghat? As per a legend, the powerful Hindu Goddess Durga Maa, threw her
        sword after she killed the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha. The exact location where the sword fell tore apart the earth
        and gave result to the formation of a river which was later named as Assi. Thus, the peaceful Assi Ghat is named after
        the Assi River.</p>
        <p>Here is story version 2. As per another legend, Lord Rudra, who is a form of Shiv Bhagwan wasangry at thebad behavior of
        the asuras. Enraged, hekilled a total of 80 asurasat what is now Assi Ghat. Since 80 means Assi in Hindi, it was named
        as Assi Ghat later.</p>
        <p><b>Where is Assi Ghat of Banaras located?</b></p>
        <p>The southernmost of all the 84 holy ghats of Varanasi (now 85 including Namo Ghat) is known as Assi Ghat. Assi Ghat is located in the heart of Varanasi, which is also known as Banaras, Benaras or Kashi.</p>
        <p>Address of Assi Ghat Varanasi is: Shivala, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, 221005, India.</p>
        <p><b>Assi Ghat length</b></p>
        <p>How long is Assi Ghat? Well, all ghats of Varanasi are of different sizes. Assi Ghat happens to be one of the longest
        ghats of Varanasi. Since Assi Ghat is located at the edge of where all ghats exist, it appears even longer and bigger
        than the other ghats of Kashi.</p>
        <p><b>Which is the first ghat in Varanasi?</b></p>
        <p>Well, if you start from Assi Ghat, it is the first of all the 84 ghats of Varanasi. And which is the last ghat in
        Varanasi? If you start at the newly built Namo Ghat, then Assi Ghat is the last ghat of Varanasi. There are no other
        ghats after the Assi Ghat. It is where the series of ghats start and end depending on where you start from.</p>
        <p><b>Which River is Assi Ghat?</b></p>
        <p>Assi Ghat is located at the confluence of the holy Ganga River and Assi River. Ganga River is the holiest of all the
        rivers in India. Hindus worship and offer prayers to Maa Ganga every day. The water of Ganga River also contains
        miraculous properties. It‚Äôs water never gets stale. Read more in the souvenir section of this blog.</p>
        <img src="./Images/travelpost7.3.jpg" alt="#" class="post-image">
        <p><b>Can we bath at Assi Ghat?</b></p>
        <p>Can we take a bath at Assi Ghat? Yes, why not! In fact, many people take a holy dip in the pious Ganga River every day.
        The confluence of the Assi River and Ganga River is considered very auspicious by devout Hindus. This is why many
        devotees take a holy dip at Assi Ghat on a daily basis. On special occasion and Hindu festivals such as Probodhoni
        Ekadashi and Makar Sakranti, devotees take a holy dip at Assi Ghat in large numbers.</p>
        <p>In the ancient Hindu scripture Kashi Khand, Assi Ghat is clearly mentioned as Assi ‚ÄúSaimbeda Tirtha‚Äù. This implies that
        the person who take a holy dip at the Assi Ghat at least once in his lifetime will earn the punya of all the Tirthas
        (pilgrimages) combined together. Having a bath here also gets one rid of all the sins committed in the past. People also
        take bath in the Ganga River here before the commence any pooja or rituals.</p>
        <p>I have been told that taking a holy dip at Assi Ghat is akin to taking a holy dip in thousands of other holy rivers.</p>
        <p>Faith and science are constant companions in Varanasi. Most of these Hindu festivals are highly backed by science as they fall on celestial events such as lunar eclipse or solar eclipse.</p>
        <p>The popular occasions when Hindus congregate at Assi Ghat to take a holy dip are:</p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">Solar eclipse</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">Lunar eclipse</li></p>

        <p><b>History of Assi Ghat</b></p>
        <p>Assi Ghat has had a long and interesting history which many people are not aware of. The historical destination of Assi Ghat has remained in public memory since times immemorial.</p>
        <p><b>Places to see in Assi Ghat of Varanasi</b></p>
        <p>Assi Ghat has so many exciting tourist attractions. Some pf the best tourist places in Varanasi are located at walking
        distance from Assi Ghat. Calling Assi Ghat as one of the epicenters of Varanasi tourism should not be an overstatement.
        Some of the best major attractions around Assi Ghat are located at a radius of 1 kilometer.</p>
        <p><b>Shivalinga under the Peepal Tree</b></p>
        <p>Located right on the Assi Ghat is a Shivalinga under the sacred Peepal Tree. There are many deities here who are worshipped by the locals daily. Bhakts or pilgrims offer the holy water of Ganga River here after they take a dip in the River Ganga.</p>
        <p>There are many more Hindu temples here such as the small marble temple. Devotees come to worship the Asisangameshwar lingam or Shivalinga here as well. Varanasi, after all is where Bhagwan Shivaa resides! This temple is one of the best places to visit in Assi Ghat, Varanasi.</p>
        <p><b>Visit the nearby Tulsi Ghat</b></p>
        <p>On which Ghat of Varanasi Tulsidas died? Great Hindu poet Tulsidas lived in the nearby Tulsi Ghat in 16th century and
        wrote the world-famous Ramcharitmanas and Hanuman Chalisa. Till I visited Varanasi, I didn‚Äôt know that Tulsidas had left
        for his heavenly abode at Assi Ghat Kashi.</p>
        <p>Did you know that the Tulsi Ghat was known as Lolarka Ghat earlier? Tulsi Ghat has remained one of the major sightseeing
        attractions near Assi Ghat Varanasi since times immemorial. Do not forget to explore the must-visit attractions of Tulsi
        Ghat near Assi Ghat.</p>
        <p><b>Visit Hanuman Ghat</b></p>
        <p>I was wondering why everyone was selling idli and masala dosa in not only road side carts but also in cafes and
        restaurants. A large community from South of India live in Hanuman Ghat. The South Indian community has also built a new
        temple here.</p>
        <p>Hanuman Ghat is also famous because the fifteenth-century Vaishnavite saint Vallabha was born here. It was he who played
        a role in the resurgence of the worship of Krishna Bhagwan. In fact, there is one more reason why Hanuman Ghat is so
        pious. You can also worship an unusual image of Ruru, the dog Bhairava, who is a ferocious and early form of Bhagwan
        Shiva. Do not miss paying respects to Sri Ruru Bhairav.</p>
        <p>Hanuman Ghat is located very close to the Assi Ghat. Other nearby ghats are Ganga Mahal Ghat and Ravidas Ghat. Hanuman Ghat is the top place to see around Assi Ghat.</p>
        <p><b>Visit Lolark Kund</b></p>
        <p>Lolark Kund is off the touristy trail. But those who know about this hidden gem near Assi Ghat, love spending time here.
        Lolark Kund is a very unusual place to see in Varanasi. I am sure you had no idea that it existed till you read this
        blog. Lolark Kund is a rectangular water tank which is dug at least 15 meters below the ground level. The steps here are
        very steep, therefore you must be careful while going up and down the stairs. Mostly, you will not see many tourists
        here due to lack of awareness.</p>
        <p>The usually abandoned water tank is abuzz with activity during the Lolarka Fair in August or September. This is when
        hordes of devotees worship Gods in the hope of the birth of a son. Not many people know that Lolark Kund is one of the
        oldest sites of Varanasi which still remains. It is, in fact one of the only 2 Sun sites which still exist. This place
        is associated with the origins of Hinduism. Even during the times of Gautam Buddha, people used to take bath here.</p>
        <p>Much before the revered deities of Hinduism as we know today, 12 Aditya or 12 divisions of Sun were worshipped here.
        That makes it one of the most important places to see in Assi Ghat Banaras. Lolark Kund is a mus-see place near Assi
        Ghat, Varanasi. The Assi Ghat neighborhood is full of such hidden gems which are off the touristy trails.</p>
        <p><b>Visit Tulsi Akhada in Assi Ghat</b></p>
        <p>Do not miss an Akhada or wrestling match at Tulsi Ghat which is located close to the Assi Ghat. I visited the Tulsi
        Akhada early morning and observed not only the kushti (wrestling) match but also the daily routine of the desi pahalwan
        aka wrestlers. The wrestlers here spend all their life mastering wrestling, Indian style. The wrestlers are friendly and
        open to a chit-chat with you if you show interest. Visiting the Tulsi Akhada is one of the best immersive experiences
        which you can have in Varanasi. It is one of the most unusual things to do in Assi Ghat Benaras.</p>
