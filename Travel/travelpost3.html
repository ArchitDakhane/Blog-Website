        <p>Gujarat is a state known for its rich culture and heritage. Be it the warm amiability of the people, the vibrant
            festivals, the folk arts or the lipsmacking Gujarati cuisine: Gujarat proudly stands out in its versatile character
            and charming persona.</p>
        <p>During my several visits to the state, I've had the chance to stay at some of the most luxurious resorts in and
            around Ahmedabad that are perfect for families, couples or solo. Most of these resorts are strategically located
            around key points of attractions yet afford a luxurious escape from the daily hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
        <p><b>1.VISAMO NALSAROVAR RESORT</b></p>
        <p>The best of luxury meets nature; smack in the middle of wilderness at Visamo Nal sarover located near the famous
        Nalsarover sanctuary around 50 km, an hour’s drive from Ahmedabad. It's so near to the city yet quietly tucked to escape
        the immediate loudness and crowdedness. Walk into the resort and you’ll breathe a breath of fresh air.</p>
