        <h1>OpenAI CEO: We may have AI superintelligence in ‚Äúa few thousand days‚Äù</h1>
        <h3>Altman says "deep learning worked" and will lead to "massive prosperity."</h3>
        <p>Published on: September 24, 2024 | By Benj Edwards </p>

    <section class="post-content">
        <p>On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlined his vision for an AI-driven future of tech progress and global prosperity in a
        new personal blog post titled "The Intelligence Age." The essay paints a picture of human advancement accelerated by AI,
        with Altman suggesting that superintelligent AI could emerge within the next decade.</p>
        <p>"It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll get there," he wrote.</p>
        <p>OpenAI's current goal is to create AGI (artificial general intelligence), which is a term for hypothetical technology
        that could match human intelligence in performing many tasks without the need for specific training. By contrast,
        superintelligence surpasses AGI, and it could be seen as a hypothetical level of machine intelligence that can
        dramatically outperform humans at any intellectual task, perhaps even to an unfathomable degree.</p>
        <img src="./Images/techpost1.1.jpg" alt="andresr via Getty Images" class="post-image">
        <p>Superintelligence (sometimes called "ASI" for "artificial superintelligence") is a popular but sometimes fringe topic
        among the machine-learning community, and it has been for years‚Äîespecially since controversial philosopher Nick Bostrom
        authored a book titled Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies in 2014. Former OpenAI co-founder and Chief
        Scientist Ilya Sutskever left OpenAI in June to found a company with the term in its name: Safe Superintelligence.
        Meanwhile, Altman himself has been talking about developing superintelligence since at least last year.</p>
        <p>So, just how long is "a few thousand days"? There's no telling exactly. The likely reason Altman picked a vague number
        is because he doesn't exactly know when ASI will arrive, but it sounds like he thinks it could happen within a decade.
        For comparison, 2,000 days is about 5.5 years, 3,000 days is around 8.2 years, and 4,000 days is almost 11 years.</p>
        <p>It's easy to criticize Altman's vagueness here; no one can truly predict the future, but Altman, as CEO of OpenAI, is
        likely privy to AI research techniques coming down the pipeline that aren't broadly known to the public. So even when
        couched with a broad time frame, the claim comes from a noteworthy source in the AI field‚Äîalbeit one who is heavily
        invested in making sure that AI progress does not stall.</p>
        <p>Not everyone shares Altman's optimism and enthusiasm. Computer scientist Grady Booch, who is a frequent critic of AI
        hype on social media, quoted Altman's "few thousand days" prediction and wrote on X, "I am so freaking tired of all the
        AI hype: it has no basis in reality and serves only to inflate valuations, inflame the public, garnet [sic] headlines,
        and distract from the real work going on in computing."</p>
        <p>Despite the criticism, it's notable when the CEO of what is probably the defining AI company of the moment makes a broad
        prediction about future capabilities‚Äîeven if that means he's perpetually trying to raise money. Building infrastructure
        to power AI services is foremost on many tech CEOs' minds these days.</p>
        <p>"If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as possible," Altman writes in his essay, "we need to drive down
        the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips). If we don‚Äôt build enough
        infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich
        people."</p>
        <h2>Altman‚Äôs vision for ‚ÄúThe Intelligence Age‚Äù</h2>
        <img src="M:\MERN Stack\Projects\Blog Clone\Images\techPost1.jpg" alt="Getty Images" class="post-image">
        <p>Elsewhere in the essay, Altman frames our present era as the dawn of "The Intelligence Age," the next transformative
        technology era in human history, following the Stone Age, Agricultural Age, and Industrial Age. He credits the success
        of deep-learning algorithms as the catalyst for this new era, stating simply: "How did we get to the doorstep of the
        next leap in prosperity? In three words: deep learning worked."</p>
        <p>"Many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but
        nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter," he wrote. "If a lamplighter could see the world
        today, he would think the prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from
        today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable."</p>
