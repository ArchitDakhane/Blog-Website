        <p>While disputes over the best ways to teach reading remain in the headlines, students are still struggling to achieve
        academic literacy. These debates have raged on for decades, but too often fail to include one key ingredient for truly
        and finally unlocking multifaceted literacy: the teaching of writing.</p>
        <p>Significant drops in reading scores across demographic groups haunt school districts in every state. Nationally, the
        average reading test score for 13-year-olds has dipped to its lowest in decades. Low literacy levels are correlated with
        greater chances of dropping out of school entirely, lower overall wages earned throughout one‚Äôs lifetime, poorer health,
        and reduced connection to one‚Äôs larger community. Our young people deserve so much more. To address these challenges, we
        must increase access to authentic, purposeful writing instruction at all ages.</p>
        <p><b>Writing Strategies to Boost Reading</b></p>
        <p>Every child learns differently, and reading can be a highly nuanced and personal practice requiring teachers to apply an
        array of strategies. Explicit phonics instruction definitively helps many students advance their reading skills, but
        others will also need more help actively comprehending as they read, linking ideas, and thinking critically. Still
        others will need help reading with greater stamina or in new genres. Some students need explicit decoding strategies
        when they come across an unknown word, and others need the confidence to employ those strategies in a variety of
        contexts. All students need more help tapping into the serious joy of reading‚Äîfinding engaging stories that speak to
        their own experiences and spark their imaginations.</p>
        <p>Writing skills can amplify these aspects of reading and help tailor instruction to each student‚Äôs needs. While phonics
        is a foundational tool for improving reading abilities, it‚Äôs often viewed solely through the lens of reading. However, I
        believe that reading is like breathing in, and writing is like breathing out. Writing actively reinforces phonics and
        the power of storytelling, making it a perfect complement to the reading work educators are already doing.</p>
        <img src="./Images/educpost7.2.png" alt="post" class="post-image">
        <p>In my work for many decades as a literacy educator, creator of many programs to motivate uncertain readers, and lifelong
        teacher, I‚Äôve used decodable model texts in a variety of ways to help students build essential writing and storytelling
        skills. These texts can serve not only as learn-to-read models, but also as guides for students‚Äô writing: for authorship
        and idea development, and even handwriting practice (yes, handwriting!). In these ways, I am strengthening my students‚Äô
        opportunities to take an active role not only as readers but as writers, too.</p>
        <p>Here are three essential overarching strategies to improve reading skills by teaching writing skills: </p>
        <p><b>1.Tap Into the Power of Students‚Äô Personal Stories </b></p>
        <p>Our students are steeped in stories from the moment they wake up to the moment they fall asleep, and the most important
        stories to them are their own. Their minds are filled with stories about their families and friends, their cultures and
        passions, their likes and dislikes, and so much more. These stories are growing and developing as they are growing and
        developing.</p>
        <p>We can help them take ownership of their stories and gain the skills and confidence they need to share them with others.
        Harnessing their natural inclination for storytelling starts by encouraging them to engage with their own stories in fun
        and welcoming ways, including through writing. As a result, they will learn to see the world of print language not just
        as something they passively receive but also as a way they and other people tell their stories.</p>
        <p>Give students engaging writing prompts based on the books you read together in class that draw on their own unique
        experiences. For example, if a story character exhibits bravery, ask students to write about a time they were brave.
        Play with genre by asking students to write a poem or an editorial about that same experience. If a book discusses
        tradition and food, invite students to write stories about their family traditions and favorite foods, sharing these
        stories with peers to foster connections.</p>
        <p>If we as educators tap into the deep well of stories within each child, the power of these stories and our students'
        excitement to share them will fuel their writing practice naturally. It will motivate them to want to put those first
        marks on the page. Those marks are the first sign of phonics in action‚Äîof the child as a storyteller who understands
        that language conveys stories.</p>
        <p><b>2.Pair Sounds and Letter Practice with Authentic Storytelling</b></p>
        <p>Help students see the reading-writing connection more actively by combining sounds and letter practice with
        meaning-making to bring the teaching of phonics to life. Invite students to identify sounds and letters by clapping,
        moving, and engaging in the real rhythms of language using their own stories. Then, have students listen for those same
        sounds in read-alouds, combining phonics practice with a narrative they can follow.</p>
        <p>Ask students to listen and pay attention to the sounds of words and use their growing knowledge of phonics-based work to
        extend their writing on the page or screen. Help them see that listening for language and adapting it to the written
        word is a key feature of becoming a lifelong writer. Work together on stretching sounds and using the alphabet to
        imprint meaning on their pages. The more we engage students as writers in exploring word construction, the more attuned
        they‚Äôll become to these features as readers.</p>
        <img src="./Images/educpost7.3.png" alt="quote" class="post-image">
        <p>For example, an emerging writer may want to write a story about going to the park with her grandmother. If the student
        wants to write the word ‚Äúpark,‚Äù speak aloud the word ‚Äúpark‚Äù together, emphasizing the /p/ sound. Then, prompt the child
        to remember the letter that makes the /p/ sound.</p>
        <p>The interplay between phonics and writing is deep and meaningful for the child as we seek to make connections between
        the sounds they hear and the meaning they make. In this way, when the child rereads her writing, even while seeing
        scribbles like, ‚ÄúI WNT TO THE PRK WITHWTH MY GRNDMA,‚Äù the writing is attached to the sounds she is celebrating as a
        meaning maker.</p>
        <p><b>3.Practice Fluency with a Classroom Writer‚Äôs Corner </b></p>
        <p>Fluency in writing is all about automaticity, expression, and accuracy. When young students are comfortable jumping into
        writing projects without fear or anxiety, they will become stronger readers and communicators.</p>
        <p>Giving students space to write in a variety of genres and formats can be transformational for students‚Äô writing and
        reading success, helping them see the literary process as a delightful, low-stakes way to express themselves. Offer
        open-ended writing prompts, or invite students to write a poem, comic book, or football playbook. Multilingual students
        should be invited to write in the language of their choice or use pictures to tell stories. Provide different types of
        paper and writing utensils for your writer‚Äôs corner, like paper that looks like scrolls for poetry or newspaper for
        articles.</p>
        <p>You can also gently encourage students to make their writing better. Include a ‚Äúsuper writer‚Äù checklist for students to
        edit their own stories, or feature alphabet charts and alphabet manipulatives where children can actively practice
        making words and letters. Writing by hand is proven to help children develop lifelong reading and writing skills. In the
        age of screens, we need to keep this practice alive in our classrooms to build true fluency in both reading and writing.</p>
        <p>You will soon find that your classroom writer‚Äôs corner has become an honored space for writing magic that propels your students forward on their lifelong literacy journeys. </p>
        <p><b>Reading Is Breathing In, Writing Is Breathing Out</b></p>
        <p>With these writing strategies, we can inspire our students to become lifelong readers too. We can inspire them to tap
        into the power of storytelling with their own stories, build both reading and writing skills through practice pairing
        sounds and letters, and create physical spaces for our students to feel safe and comfortable writing to develop fluency.
        By leveraging these writing strategies, we are doing legacy work: equipping our students with the inhale and exhale of
        literacy, empowering them for a lifetime.</p>
