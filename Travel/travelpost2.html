    <section class="post-content">
        <p>Standing alone in a narrow passage, I am lost wondering which of the dark mysterious paths in front of me would lead me
        to my destination. The voices echo around me but I cannot see anyone. Behind me is a corridor that opens to a door that
        takes me to another corridor with a door. I look around me and I see no one. All of a sudden, I hear a familiar voice
        and my guide emerges out of a dark corner. For a moment I realized that I was almost close to being lost in a labyrinth
        with 1000 passages and 489 doorways that clone each other ‚Äì the famous Bhool Bhulaiya of the Bara Imambara in Lucknow in
        Uttar Pradesh.</p>
        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.1.jpeg" alt="Lucknow" class="post-image">
        <p>If there is one monument in Lucknow that fills me in awe then it is the Bara Imambara. But it is the story behind it
        that leaves me even more speechless. We go back in time to the 18th century ‚Äì 1784 to be precise when Awadh province was
        ravaged by a famine. The Nawab of Awadh, Asaf ud Daula hit upon an idea to find employment for his starving populace,
        both the rich and the poor. And that is how the Bara Imambara was born ‚Äì it was neither a mosque nor a mausoleum but was
        meant to be a prayer hall where the Shia Muslim community could congregate for mourning during Muharram.</p>
        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.2.jpeg" alt="Lucknow" class="post-image">
        <p>The work on this historic edifice began. While the labourers worked brick by brick every morning building the monument,
        the elite would start their work at night, tearing down the entire structure, and razing it to the ground. The cycle
        continued for eleven years until the monument called Asafi Imambara or the Bara Imambara was completed. Over 20000
        people worked on this project which was based on the design of a Delhi-based architect, Kifayatullah who won the project
        through a competition.</p>

        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.4.jpeg" alt="people" class="post-image">
        <p>It is a bright and sunny day as we walk past the two imposing gateways that lead you through mosques, step wells,
        courtyards, and landscaped gardens to the main central hall. The first thing that you see is the absence of beams
        supporting the large hall measuring over 50 by 16 meters, which is over 15 meters in height. There are three halls here
        and chandeliers hang from the ceiling creating an ornate look.</p>
        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.5.jpeg" alt="cave" class="post-image">
        <p>My guide says that this is the largest arched hall in the world built without pillars to support it. And the Bhool
        Bhulaiya of Bara Imambara was designed by the architect to ensure that the monument did not need pillars, by reducing
        the weight of the ceiling and making it hollow.</p>
        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.6.jpg" alt="architecture" class="post-image">
        <p>And it eventually became the showstopper. If you are without a guide, you can lose your sense of direction as every
        passage and door in this labyrinth clones each other. It is believed that there are underground tunnels leading to
        cities but they have been sealed by the British.</p>
        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.7.jpeg" alt="building" class="post-image">
        <p>Finally, we are at the rooftop taking in the entire view of the complex. The Asafi Mosque stands adjacent and I can see
        the Shahi Baoli. There are stories everywhere. One of them speaks about how one of the treasurers of a Nawab had jumped
        into the well so that the British would not capture him. The shutterbugs are active taking photographs of every view.
        Inspired by a combination of Persian and Mughal architecture, the Bara Imambara cocoons you into a world, away from the
        chaos of the old town.</p>
        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.8.jpeg" alt="Lucknow" class="post-image">
        <p>Wading through the old town of Lucknow, we cross the Rumi Darwaza built by the same Nawab during the famine. The
        60-foot-tall gate resembles an old doorway in Turkey and is referred to as the Turkish gate. We barely linger as traffic
        piles up and the sun‚Äôs harsh rays strike us. Our next destination is the Chota Imambara which goes by the name of
        Husainabad Imambara built by the Nawab, Mohabbat Ali Shah who is buried here with his mother.</p>

        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.10.jpeg" alt="Lucknow" class="post-image">
        <p>A study in contrast, the Chota Imambara as the name suggests is not just small but a petite monument that bursts into
        opulence the moment you enter it. Entering through the gates called Naubat Khana, we see a beautiful hall filled with
        chandeliers and clocks from Belgium and Paris. Every corner of the hall glitters with these lovely lanterns and the
        British called it ‚ÄúPalace of Lights.‚Äù</p>

        <img src="./Images/travelpost2.12.jpeg" alt="Lucknow" class="post-image">
        <p>The facade and the walls are very beautifully decorated with Quranic verses in Islamic calligraphy. There is a mosque, a
        mausoleum, and a hammam in this complex. Looking up you can see a gilded dome and several minarets. There was meant to
        be a seven-storeyed tower called Satkhanda, but you can see only four levels as construction was stopped after the reign
        of the Nawan. It was meant to be a watch tower and a spiral staircase takes you up the tower. There is also a Treasury
        built right in front of the tomb. The entire Imambara is so serene that I sit there for a long time, imbibing the beauty
        and the peaceful atmosphere until it is time to move on.</p>
