        <h1>Make the most of the school year with new Chromebook features</h1>
        <h3>From new Chromebooks to new AI tools, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new for the new school year.</h3>

    <section class="post-content">
        <img src="./Images/educpost4.1.jpeg" alt="Chromebook" class="post-image">
        <p>The start of a new school year (in the Northern Hemisphere) means 50 million students and educators will be powering up
        their Chromebooks in classrooms around the world ‚Äî putting the work of their IT administrators to the test. For us at
        Google, it means continuing to protect Chromebooks against persistent threats like ransomware to keep learning going,
        and rolling out new features to help students, educators and admins alike reach their full potential. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre
        doing just that.</p>
        <p><b>Try new lightweight, sleek Chromebooks</b></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">Teachers need thin and lightweight devices to rely on for all-day teaching. The new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus is
        just that. Starting at $699 USD, it‚Äôs an ultra-portable laptop, in an eye-catching neptune blue color. It‚Äôs also the
        first Chromebook Plus to have the Quick Insert key, to help you get what you need fast.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">The versatile and slim Lenovo Chromebook Duet EDU G2 is the ideal school-to-home device, starting at $319 USD. Students
        can shift from laptop to tablet mode as they walk around the classroom with the included rugged case, or you can put up
        the kickstand to show a video. The Lenovo USI Pen 2* enables sketching with precision, and a MediaTek Kompanio 838
        processor delivers anytime speed.</li></p>
        <p><b>Level up your teaching with AI on Chromebook Plus</b></p>
        <p>Chromebook Plus is powerful enough for advanced workflows, with Google AI built in. These features are all rolling out in the next few weeks, along with admin controls for all generative AI features, available to anyone 18 and older.</p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;margin-bottom: 15px;line-height: 1.6;">With Help me write on Chromebook Plus, you can easily lean on Google for help creating differentiated content and
        materials for students with different needs and abilities. Just right-click on any text box and "Help me write" will
        offer suggestions to enhance your text. It can condense or add emojis, or even adjust the tone of your writing to be
        more formal.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">Discover new insights with Help me read. This tool makes it easy for you to summarize PDFs, articles or websites with
        just a right-click. Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into the content ‚Äî and soon, you'll be able to highlight
        specific sentences or paragraphs for clarification.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">With Live Translate*, you‚Äôll be able to help learners understand content in their native language ‚Äî or in the language
        they‚Äôre learning. Live Translate enables Google AI-translated captions in more than 100 languages on media streams,
        whether it‚Äôs a video you post to Classroom or a video in a research article online.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">The Quick Insert key, first coming to the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, helps educators get what you need fast.
        Whether you're looking for editing suggestions, URL linking or the ideal GIF to put in a Slide deck, a simple tap on the
        new keyboard button unveils a menu filled with helpful options. When using Quick Insert, you can include not only Drive
        files, but also local files like screenshots (a teacher favorite!) or images.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">We recently announced we‚Äôre bringing Gemini to Google Workspace for Education. With these tools, education leaders can
        get even more generative AI features built into Google Workspace for Education to help with lesson planning, content
        creation and more. If you purchase 25 or more Chromebook Plus devices, you qualify for promotions on Gemini for
        Workspace. Learn more in the one pager and website.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">Create voice recordings and audio content with the new Recorder app. Record voices for class projects, note-taking ‚Äì and
        even podcasts ‚Äì using built-in AI-powered voice recording on your Chromebook, with transcriptions built in. The Recorder
        app is available on all Chromebooks, but the AI-powered speaker identification and a summary of recorded content, along
        with noise cancellation, are only available on Chromebook Plus.</li></p>
        <p>In May, we shared that many other new features would be coming ‚Äì and they‚Äôre now rolling out through the end of the
        year. Take advantage of the Google Tasks and Calendar integrations to help you check and update your to-do lists and
        Classroom assignments from your Chromebook desktop.</p>
        <p><b>Find more features for all learners on Chromebooks</b></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">Chromebooks are here to help eliminate wasted class time. When you log in, Welcome Recap will give you a visual overview
        of where you left off and helpful suggestions to get back into the flow ‚Äî like a reminder of upcoming classes or
        activities, or quick access to a recently opened file.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">To help you focus on those tasks at hand ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs an in-class assignment for your students or a lesson plan ‚Äî you
        can choose a window of time, a Google Task you want to finish and a soundscape. Then Focus can automatically turn on ‚ÄúDo
        Not Disturb‚Äù for a distraction-free experience.</li></p>
        <img src="./Images/educpost4.2.gif" alt="Chrome" class="post-image">
        <p><b>Lead, manage and secure devices with Google Admin console</b></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">IT admins can get all the info they need about their fleet in the central Device Hub in Google Admin console. The Hub
        also provides proactive alerts based on potential problems to make fleet management seamless.</li></p>
        <p><li style="color: #555;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;margin-bottom: 15px;">There are more than 600 policies in Google Admin console, and it can be time-consuming to find the one you‚Äôre looking
        for. With our new simplified filtering for policies, you'll be able to easily catch up on new feature releases and the
        most popular settings. And coming soon, you'll be able to use natural language to search the entire policy and device
        lists, which will provide ML-ranked results based on your intent and automatically apply relevant device filters to meet
        your needs.</li></p>
